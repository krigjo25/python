##  About Birthdays

###  JavaScript

The JavaScript serves as a client to fetch the content from contenteditable contents from a specific
button and send it through ajax to the server side, its a work around as the server can not do multi-tasking naturally.
So on submit the ajax sends through the code to the server.

#### Table Functionallity

-   Delete a record                         ✅
-   Order by name, bday                     ✅
-   Inserting a new record                  ✅
-   Edit a record (using contenteditable)   ✅

## Project summary

### Challanges


-   During the project several challanges occured under the development some about the contenteditable attribute and form submission.
A function was created containing ajax to send the information as an alternative way instead of sending it directly to the server.
In order to create that function i had to loop through the content, by using a for loop and ensuring the button value matches.
