Question 10.1.2

After coding the subclasses, create anotherfile called "shapemain.py".

Within shapemain.py import the classes in "shape.py" and instantiate one instance
of each subclasses using the following information :

A Square instance called sq with a length of 5.
A Circle instance called c with a radius of 10.
A Triangle instance called t with a base of 12 and a height of 4.

Question 10.1.3

Use the print() function to display information about each instance.
'''

c = C(11.1)
s = S(7.5)
t = T(3.2, 5)

print ("Question 10.1 : \n", c, "\n", s, "\n", t, "\n")

print ("Question 10.2 : \n", c + s, "\n")

print ("Question 10.3 : \n", c + s + t)
