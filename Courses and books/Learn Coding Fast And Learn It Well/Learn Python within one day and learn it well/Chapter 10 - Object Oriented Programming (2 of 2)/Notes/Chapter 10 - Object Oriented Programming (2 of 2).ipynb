    "\n",
    "Main feature of a sub class is that it inherits all the variables and methods from the parent class, which means they're not needed to be coded again and the sub class can have additional variables and methods that do not exist in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for coding a subclasses is to facilitate code reuse. One way to do it is to use a builtin function called **super()** it's a pre-built function that can be used in a sub class to call a method in the super.class. In python 3, we do not have to pass any values for the self parameter. In Python 2 you have to assign the subclass a name and the keyword self. There is a common practise to do so, for backwards compatibility.\n",

    "Beside using the super() function, we can use its parent class name to call a method in the base class.\n",
