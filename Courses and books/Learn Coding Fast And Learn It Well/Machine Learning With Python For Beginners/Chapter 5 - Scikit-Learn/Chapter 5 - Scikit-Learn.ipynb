    "### 5.1.1 Organizational Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is a massive library in python that comes with an extensive assortment of classes and functions for performing various machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These classes and functions are grouped into numerous modules that are intuitively named.\n",
    "\n",
    "classes for building decision tree-based models are found in the **sklearn.tree** module while classes for data preprocessing are in the **sklearn.preprocessing** module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes are named appropriately. \n",
    "\n",

    "**StandardScaler**\n",

    "### 5.1.2 Estimators, Transformers, and Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "Sklearn follows an object oriented approach and is built around three main types of objects **estimators**, **transformers** and **predictors**. estimator have the **fit()** method, transformers have the **transform()** method and predictors have the **predict()** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimators and the fit() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimator refers to any object that learns ( i.e estimates or calculate some parameters) from a input data. This learning happens inside the fit() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transform and the transform() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Some estimators also transform a dataset. These estimators are known as transformers and perform the transformation inside a method called **transform()**. This method accepts an array as input and uses the parameters calculated by the fit() method of the same object to return a transformed dataset.\n",
    "'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predictors and the predict() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Some estimators are able to make predictions when given a dataset. These estimators are known as predictors and perform the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes predictions based on the parameters calculated by the fit() method."

A simple workaround to handle these missing values is to discard their rows or columns using the dropna()"
