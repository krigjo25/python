## Notes

### Python functions

During the project I have learned alot about Python functions<br>
How to define a function, how the syntax of a function works in real life.


### Python Try, except, else

I have learned the importance of using `Try, except, else`,<br>
in the code, it has a better structure.

its a better design as developers can see what you are attempting to do <br>


### Python List

During the projects I've learned how to declear, initialize<br>
a 1D Array or 2D Arrays. To make the workflow easier for to read.

List or arrays are a short term solution to store information which is going to be used in the project.

### Python del

Using Python's `del` is important to clear space from memory, to avoid using unneccessary memories, for the sake of resources.


### SQL Database


During the project I have learned the basic understanding of a<br>
`Structure Query Language` hereby it's Alias will be used (`SQL`).

Database is used to store information the database can be static which means values never changes<br>
dynamically which means the values can change.

`tables` are created to sort data in columns and rows
