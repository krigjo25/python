### Guess the number

The intention of the game is to prompt the user for an integer, and the user<br>
has to guess which integer the program generated, which is generated each time <br>
while the players has won,

Based on level the difficulty may vary, but the user gets a hint if the user types in a less or greater than answer.

> USAGE : In your terminal, type intgames.py -h to view the commands available for the game


### The Little proffesor

The intention of the game is to prompt the user for a mathimatical question for<br>
the user to solve, the mathimatical question is randomly generated, by a code.
The following program has a level system where the higher level,
the more difficult the mathimatical question can be.

> USAGE : In your terminal, type intgames.py -h to view the commands available for the game

Originally this game was created as an
assignment at CS50P - Introduction to Python Programming.

#### Mathimatical operators used in the program 

-   Additions, 
-   Substractions,
-   Multiply
 
<!-- ( `dividision` (floor, reminder), `power of` and `binary numbers`,) -->
