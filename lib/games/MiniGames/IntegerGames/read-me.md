has to guess which integer the code generated, which is generated each time <br>
while the players has won,

Based on level the difficulty may vary, but the user gets a hint if the user types in a less or greater than answer.

### Little proffesor

The intention of the game is to prompt the user for a mathimatical question for<br> the user to solve, the mathimatical question is randomly generated, by a code.

The following program has a level system where the higher level, the more difficult the mathimatical question can be.

Mathimatical operators used in the program 
-   `additions`, `substractions`
 
<!-- (`multiplications`, `dividision` (floor, reminder), `power of` and `binary numbers`,) -->
